# week_1_led_blink
Getting started with STM32 development with a LED blink project

**Week 1: STM32 Setup & Basic Hardware Interface**

**Get familiar with STM32CubeIDE:** Set up STM32CubeIDE or STM32CubeMX. These tools help generate initialization code for peripherals.

*LED Setup:** Start with basic GPIO to control a single LED on one of the STM32 pins (e.g., onboard LED or external LED with resistor).
  * Write a simple program to blink the LED. 
  * Use STM32CubeMX to configure the GPIO pin for output mode.
* **Learn STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** This is the standard way to interface with peripherals like GPIOs, UART, SPI, etc., on STM32.
