# week_1_led_blink
Getting started with STM32 development with a LED blink project

**Week 1: STM32 Setup & Basic Hardware Interface**

* **Get familiar with STM32CubeIDE:** Set up STM32CubeMX/STM32CubeIDE
  * **TODO** Add some notes on innitial project set-up for CubeMX and CubeIDE
    * Blah
    * Blah
    * "Run Configurations", etc
* **LED Setup:** Start with basic GPIO to control a single LED on one of the STM32 pins (e.g., onboard LED or external LED with resistor).
  * Use STM32CubeMX to configure the GPIO pin for output mode.
  * Write a simple program to blink the LED. 
* **Learn STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer):** This is the standard way to interface with peripherals like GPIOs, UART, SPI, etc., on STM32.
